## 18:15 - Jos Helmich - Industrial Cyber Security

Jos' presentation on Industrial Cyber Security was an interesting one. The scope of the presentation was quite large and complex and as a person who does not have that much experience on Industrial side of securuty, it was a lot of new information to be taken in.

Points discussed
* Legistalation and cyber security: How NIS-2 directive and CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) affect to large scale manufacturing and industrial organisations.
* Differences of requirements relating to NIS-2 in manufacturing and comparison of differences between Office Cloud (normal office requirements), Industrial Cloud (Network requirements etc)  and Industrial zone (non-network zone)
* The differences and usage of different ISO standards. Jos introduced us a litany of industry starndards that are monitored as a part of CRA (If I understood correctly) such as ISO-27001, password lenghts, cybersecurity and such.
* Adressed also EU AI Act that has implications in Product safety, GDPR and CRA

I especially appreciated the introduction of standars in Jos' prsentation. I like standadrds and similar guidelines that can and should be used to explain why things needs to be done. They make communication and user support also more easy. I think I also was able to better understand NIS2 and CRA - while my organisation is implementing NIS2 requirements, they have still been bit vague to me.

To certain extent the prsentation was bit difficult to follow up: first things was the fact that I had not that much experience on the topic and second because the sound quality was somewhat bad so I may have messied something.


## 19:20 - Heikki ”zokol” Juva - State of Union

Heikki's presentation on regulation, testing and monitoring consumer technology epplications and their cyber security related functionalities was also interesting one, albeit I had even less information on that topic. He presented consumer application of two-way baby-monitor?

Points discussed
* RED (EU Radio Equipment Directive) that will be applicable 08/2025 and how that will affect to consumer electonics with radio capabilities and how popular devices and devicec connected to web should be analysed before use.
* The topic of RED was also tied to CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) and the readiness of companies to comply to CRA. This included topics on system level compatibitily, outsorucing of security and
* As Heikki specializes in R&D, he put high ephasis of testing of consumer deviced against these regulations. Questions asked were for example  "what factors affect on device security" and what kinds of security concerns consumer devices have.

Heikki has high professionalism on hie field of expertise and in addition to just listening to him, it would have been intersting to actually see him doing his work and hear him speak as he does testing. 

## Additional comments

Overall, topics complimented each others very well and while my understanding of either topic was not that high, I think I was able to grasp what cyber security specialist are after during upcoming years. 

I was also quite interested in hearing how Mehiläinen operates their cybersecurity. Their approach seemed to be quite unique with offensive approach. Would have been interesting to hear even more about that.
